React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interface. It helps developers manage "state" by using components. We interact with the DOM in our code using JSX which allows us to write code in JavaScript, and JavaScript like HTML for our web page. React helps the webpage only address components whose state has changed and then paint those to the screen instead of the entire page/application. Large applications which have a lot of data and/or states to manage, for example, Netflix, take advantage of this to optimize their applications for speed, performance modularity, and account for low-perofmance devices by using React. https://brainhub.eu/blog/10-famous-apps-using-reactjs-nowadays/
